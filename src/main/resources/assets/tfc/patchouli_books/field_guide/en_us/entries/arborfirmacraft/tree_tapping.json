If the conditions are right, your barrel will immediately begin to fill with sap."

Hevea trees produce latex only when the temperature is above 22°C. Rubber Figs produce latex at 12°C or above, but produce more slowly than Hevea. Latitude, altitude, time of the year, and the time of day all impact the temperature, and thus the flow of sap."
